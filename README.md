This repository contains a collection of detection rules for threat hunting and malware detection. Most of the samples used for analysis and to develop the detection rules are sourced from Abuse.ch or other public resources. The goal of this repository is to create detection rules that are highly accurate, performant, and optimized for minimal rule size.
